## Two main simulation methods

In the previous lecture, we performed a first analysis of a many-body,
interacting system; that is, a system in which particle interactions are
included in the potential energy function of the system. We also saw
that for even a very simple model, the two-dimensional Ising model,
analytically calculating system properties becomes immensely complex
when interactions are included. For most systems of interest, such as
condensed matter systems, analytical solutions are impossible.

How, then, can we leverage the strength of statistical mechanics - that
is, relating microscopic features of a system to macroscopic
thermodynamic properties via the partition function - if the partition
function cannot be analytically obtained? One solution is to simulate
the systems of interest to sample system configurations according to the
correct underlying probability distribution rooted in the findings from
statistical mechanics. These simulations, which we will refer to as
**molecular simulations** to distinguish from alternative simulation
methodologies that focus on computing quantum mechanical properties,
will be the focus of the next few lectures.

In this class, we will focus on two major types of simulation methods:
{term}`Monte Carlo simulations`, abbreviated as MC simulations, and
{term}`molecular dynamics simulations`, abbreviated as MD simulations. MC
and MD simulations aim to calculate the same properties of a system, but
the two methods differ in their approach. The two methods can be
compared by recalling the ergodic hypothesis, which states that the
time-average value of a system property $Y$ over a sufficiently long
timescale $\tau$ is equivalent to the ensemble-average value of that
same property (from [Lecture 2](Lecture2)):

$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^{\tau} Y(t) dt &= \sum p_i Y_i 
    
\end{aligned}$$

Which can be visualized like this:

```{glossary}
Monte Carlo simulations
    simulations which use [Monte Carlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)
    to determine the probability distribution of configurations, such
    that we can determine the ensemble-average properties
```

In MC simulations, we take an approach consistent with the right-hand
side of the equation above and attempt to directly sample configurations
from the equilibrium ensemble, weighted according to their probability
$p_i$. MC simulations thus relate more directly to the tools of
statistical mechanics, specifically because the probability of a
particular configuration can be determined based on the corresponding
statistical ensemble (i.e., a Boltzmann weight is associated with each
state in the canonical ensemble). Sampling from an equilibrium ensemble
then requires calculating these probabilities, which in practice
requires an expression for the energy of each configuration. Unlike MD
simulations, there is no attempt made in conventional MC simulations to
explicitly represent time and there is no need to calculate forces, so
the underlying potential energy surface can be discontinuous if desired.
Similarly, there does not have to be a physical path between states
sampled as long as the energy is well-defined for each state. These
strengths of MC simulations are also weaknesses, however, as inherently
time-dependent properties (such as a diffusion coefficient) cannot be
accurately measured.

```{glossary}
molecular dynamics simulations
    molecular simulations which use Newton's [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion)
    to determine the time-evolution of a system of particles, such that
    we can extract the time-average properties
```

In MD simulations, we explicitly simulate the time-evolution of particle
positions using a modified version of Newton's equations of motion in
which forces are calculated, used to compute particle velocities, and
then particle positions are determined by integrating the equation of
motion with a discrete, short time interval (i.e. the *simulation
timestep*). This approach effectively treats the computer simulation as
an experiment and extracts time-average simulation properties. Hence,
the MD approach models the left-hand side of the above equation. The
challenge with MD simulations is often ensuring that $\tau$ is
sufficiently long to sample states from the observed system; in other
words, ensuring that a system is both in equilibrium and ergodic is a
major challenge of MD. From a practical standpoint, the MD equations of
motion require the calculation of forces, which requires the potential
energy function of the system to be everywhere continuous and
differentiable.

We will learn more details about each of these algorithms in the next
few lectures. First, however, we will discuss some initial topics
regarding how a physical system is actually modeled in a simulation
representation.

## Model description of a simulation system

Regardless of whether we sample a simulation observable using a MC or MD
method, we first need to understand how to model a physical system. This
choice is system specific and depends on many factors, including the
length scale over which we expect interesting behavior, the importance
of thermal motions, etc. Here, we will summarize various ways to
represent a physical system and comment on examples in the literature
for which they are commonly used.

### Particle-based representations

The most common simulation model consists of a set of $N$ particles,
where each particle represents either a single atom or some collection
of atoms. A single configuration of the system is then specified by by
the coordinates $\textbf{r}^N$ and momenta $\textbf{p}^N$ of all $N$
particles. In this notation, $\textbf{r}^N$ represents a
$3N$-dimensional vector of all particle coordinates in 3D; the bold font
indicates a vector. Particles are typically also associated with
chemical properties such as a set of masses, charges, and interaction
parameters.

There are three common ways of representing molecules in particle-based
simulations. In all-atom simulations, each atom is represented by a
particle. In united-atom simulations, all aliphatic carbon atoms and
their bonded hydrogen atoms are combined into a single particle, while
all remaining atoms are represented as individual particles. In
coarse-grained simulations, multiple atoms are combined into a single
particle, with the number of atoms corresponding to each particle
defined by as the extent of coarse-graining. While clearly representing
every atom in a system yields the most detailed information, the
trade-off is that including additional particles increases the
computational expense of the simulation. Hence, the goal of
coarse-graining is to remove explicit descriptions of particles that
contribute minimally to the behavior of the system (often solvent
molecules, for example) in favor of reducing the computational expense
of calculations, which in turn allows for longer simulations (e.g. a
longer observation time $\tau$ in a MD simulation, or more states
sampled in a MC simulation). Devising methods to accurately remove atoms
from a simulation while retaining the same behavior as at a more
detailed length scale is the primary challenge in coarse-graining.

![image](figs/fig_9B_2.png)

Example systems typically modeled at each level of resolution include:

-   All-atom - single solutes in solution (e.g. ions in water); small
    proteins; nanomaterials; small molecules

-   United-atom - lipids; self-assembled monolayers; surfactants

-   Coarse-grained - polymers; multicomponent cell membranes; liquid
    crystals, macromolecular complexes

Consider it like this -- each particle adds a level of complexity to
computing the simulation, as each particle has its own sets of forces
and interactions. In your simulation, you want to use the _fewest_
number of particles that you can and still capture the relevant physics.

### Lattice models

Another means of representing a system is by projecting all coordinates
onto a discrete set of lattice points, as opposed to a continuous set of
coordinates; we solved lattice models analytically for the {term}`Langmuir
adsorption isotherm` and the {term}`Ising model` in the Statistical Mechanics unit. A
lattice model is an inherently (highly) coarse-grained system, and is
typically used for systems for which MD simulations are inappropriate
due to the difficulty in sampling a system ergodically. Due to the
discretization of lattice positions, lattice models are typically used
with MC sampling since forces may be not be easily obtained.

Beyond the MC simulations studied in this class, lattice models are
often used with field-based simulation techniques, such as
self-consistent field theory, or with techniques in which the system is
treated using equations from continuum mechanics (finite element
analysis) or fluid dynamics (Lattice Boltzmann methods). These
techniques are beyond the scope of this class. Examples of systems in
which lattice models may be used with MC simulations include [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_protein),
[polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_fluctuation_model),
and [vacancy diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_diffusion_coefficient).

## Interactions between particles

Having defined various ways of representing a physical system and
modeling the positions of particles, we now can define how interactions
are defined in a molecular system. Interactions are defined in terms of
a potential energy function that is a function of particle coordinates
(along with other possible system parameters, such as the presence of an
external field).

First, we will consider potentials in typical atomistic or
coarse-grained, particle-based simulations, as these potentials are
common for both MC and MD simulations of distinct molecules.
Interactions can largely be divided into two classes:

```{glossary}
bonded interactions
    interactions meant to represent bonds, bond angles, and torsional angles;

non-bonded interactions
    interactions between atoms/particles that are not bonded together, and generally reflect common intermolecular forces
```

![image](figs/fig_9B_3-01.png)

Just like scientific definitions of _bonds_, these categories are not discrete, we just choose to treat these types of
interactions differently for simplicity.

In most such systems, non-bonded interactions are assumed to be a

```{glossary}
pairwise interaction
    an interaction that only involves a pairs of particles
```

as opposed to a

```{glossary}
many-body interaction
    an interaction between a set of 3 or more particles
```

```{admonition} Which do you think is more [computationally complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity): pairwise or many-body interactions?
<details><summary> Click for answer </summary>

Many-body interactions, by far, as they require iterating over every n-body set to sum up interaction terms
(and we know from combinatorics that the number of sets increases factorially when the set size grows).
The computational complexity of many-body interactions is the primary reason why most interaction potentials are
given as pairwise -- you don't lose _too much_ information by omitting many-body terms, so it can be situationally
advantageous to ignore them.
</details>
```

Below, we summarize several typical
potentials that would be used primarily in atomistic or coarse-grained
MD simulations that fall into each of these categories.

### Bonded potentials

Bonds in real systems emerge from quantum mechanics, and hence any
simulation representation that neglects electron degrees of freedom is
an approximation to a covalent bond. Most atomic simulations include
potentials to restrict bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles,
with the typical implementation of these potentials being a harmonic
spring. Since the specifics of this approach will vary significantly on
a case-by-case basis we will not discuss bonded potentials in more
detail other than recognizing their existence.

### Non-bonded potentials

The most common non-bonded interaction in molecular simulations is the

```{glossary}
[Lennard-Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential)
    the 12-6 potential, which is typically written as:

    $$\begin{aligned}
        E_{\textrm{LJ}}(r_{ij}) &= 4\epsilon_{ij} \left [ \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^6 \right ] 
    
    \end{aligned}$$
```

Here, $r_{ij}$ is the (scalar) distance between particle $i$ and $j$,
$\epsilon_{ij}$ is a characteristic interaction energy and $\sigma_{ij}$
is a characteristic interaction length scale describing the approximate
diameter of a particle. The Lennard-Jones potential is broken into an
attractive interaction that scales with $r^{-6}$ and a repulsive
potential that scales with $r^{-12}$.

The attractive potential represents three contributions to typical van der Waals interactions
that are all attractive and scale with $r^{-6}$:

```{glossary}
[London dispersion forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_dispersion_force)
    interactions stemming from the instantaneous dipoles that arise from quantum mechanical considerations

[Debye force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force#Debye_force_(permanent_dipoles%E2%80%93induced_dipoles))
    attractions between dipoles on a molecule and induced dipoles that arise from the polarizibility of a
    different molecule

[Keesom interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force#Keesom_force)
    interactions which emerge from the orientation dependence of dipole-dipole interactions
```

In general, we do
not attempt to divide the LJ potential into contributions from these
three distinct interactions, but rather empirically identify parameters
for $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ which capture all three effects. The
repulsive potential represents [Pauli exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle),
which acts to ensure
that particle wave functions do not overlap. There is no single scaling
relation for Pauli exclusion other than that it must be a strong
repulsive force, so for computational convenience $r^{-12}$ is chosen
since the calculated $r^{-6}$ term can be simply squared.

In addition to van der Waals interactions, it is typical to associate
charges (or partial charges, to account for the unequal distribution of
electrons throughout a molecule that leads to dipoles) to atoms or
particles in a system. These charges interact via a

```{glossary}
long-range [Coulombic potential](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Oregon_Institute_of_Technology/OIT%3A_CHE_202_-_General_Chemistry_II/Unit_2%3A_Electrons_in_Atoms/2.1%3A_Coulomb's_Law_and_the_Electrostatic_Potential)

    $$E_{\textrm{coulomb}}(r_{ij}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}$$
```

where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\epsilon_r$ is
the relative dielectric constant (1 in vacuum, 2-4 in oil, 80 in water),
and $q_i$ is the charge on particle $i$. In practice, Coulombic
interactions are difficult to calculate in simulations due to periodic
boundary conditions because they decay slowly and the minimum image
convention is a severe underestimate of the total magnitude of
electrostatic interactions. Instead, advanced techniques, such as [Ewald
summations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_summation), have been derived handle their calculation. Such methods are
outside of the scope of this discussion but are discussed in {cite:ts}`frenkel_understanding_2002` if you would like to review them on your own.

Many other non-bonded interactions are possible and in common use, but
these represent the two most common functional forms used in most
atomistic simulations.

### Interactions in MC simulations

The interactions described above are all described by potentials that
are continuous and differentiable, and thus can be used in molecular
dynamics simulations. However, Monte Carlo simulations can use any
potential energy function regardless of whether it is differentiable,
expanding the repertoire of possible interactions. Some examples of
interactions used in MC simulations are noted here.

The first is a

```{glossary}
[hard-particle interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_spheres)
    interactions where particles are strictly not allowed to
    overlap (akin to an infinitely strong repulsive potential part of the
    Lennard-Jones interaction):

    $$E_{\textrm{hard}}(r_{ij}) =  \left\{  \begin{array}{ccc}
        \infty &,& r_{ij} < \sigma \\
        0&,& r_{ij} \geq \sigma
        \end{array} \right\}$$
```

Another example is the interaction between nearest-neighbors used in the
Ising model, which can be easily represented in MC simulations:

$$E_{\textrm{Ising}}(r_{ij}) =  \left\{  \begin{array}{ccc}
    -J &,& \text{if $i,j$ are neighbors} \\
    0&,&\text{otherwise}
    \end{array} \right\}$$

In principle, many other possible interactions could be defined; here we
only included a subset that are commonly found in the simulation
literature and map directly to many experimental problems.

```{admonition} Why can we use non-differentiable potentials in MC, but not MD?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Newton's equations of motion require that the potentials used in MD are differentiable
in order to obtain correct forces.

In MC, we use the potential calculate the relative probability of two states, in order
to determine whether or not it is probabilistic to move from state 1 to state 2. No
differentiation required!
